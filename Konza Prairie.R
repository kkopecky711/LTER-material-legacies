#### Konza Prairie LTER ####

## Notes
# Explore relationship of previous year dead biomass on current year productivity
# Should not group forbs and grass; grass could be considered the foundation species, and forbs neither produce legacies in the same way, nor are they annuals

# Look at relationship between dead biomass and biomass of forbs and woody 

# potential relationships between dead biomass and abiotic conditions (soil temperature, soil moisture, N content)

# Look into % cover data as well

# Watershed = fire treatment: 004 means burned every four years, 020 = every 20 years, b = statistical replicate
# Soiltype: tu = lowland, thick, moist; fl = upland, thin, rocky, drier

# Consider trying a running mean approach
